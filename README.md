# Nootch Social Media


## Description
Nootch is a social media app that allows you to connect with your friends. It has a secure login implementation for keeping your data private. 
You can see and share the trending content just with a few clicks.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
